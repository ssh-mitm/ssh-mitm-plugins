# SSH-MITM Plugins

## ⚠️ The code in this repository is currently undergoing restructuring!


Welcome to the SSH-MITM Plugin Repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for showcasing the development of various plugins for the [SSH-MITM](https://github.com/ssh-mitm/ssh-mitm).

SSH-MITM is a powerful tool used for intercepting and modifying SSH connections for various purposes, including security testing, network analysis, and more. Plugins extend the functionality of SSH-MITM, allowing you to tailor its capabilities to suit your specific needs.

In this repository, you'll find a collection of well-documented example plugins, each highlighting different aspects of plugin development. These examples cover a wide range of use cases, from custom authentication methods and logging to advanced manipulation of SSH traffic.
